# PingPong
ðŸŽ¾ Ping Pong for two players in Kotlin with focus on cooperation of both players rather than on competitivness.

In this app-game two players handles a paddle just like in [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) game but the goal (instead of
beating up the opponent with enormous pong skills) is to survive as long as possible with the ball speeding up every time it hits the paddle.
So in this variation both players are bumping their combined total score as much as possible before one of them lose three lifes.
